            <h1>Yosemite Chapel</h1>
            <p>Driving into the Valley during winter months is always treacherous.  We were lucky, reaching the Valley just after a snow storm.  The chapel, nestled in the Valley, has been a favorite wedding venue for over 130 years.  You can even bring your own minister and invite up to 125 guests.</p>
